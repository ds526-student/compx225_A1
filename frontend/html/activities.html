                        Today we had a workshop on Python programming.
                        <br><br>
                        For those new to the language, we covered the basics of Python including syntax, data types, and control structures.
                        For the more experienced, we explored pygame for game development as we learnt to create a mini top down shooter game.
                        It was a great opportunity for everyone to learn and share knowledge about Python programming.

                        Today we had a guest speaker, Jonathan Rogers, technical director at Grinding Gear Games located in Auckland.
                        As one of the founders of the company, he shared his journey in the gaming industry and provided insights into game development.
                        He discussed the challenges and successes he has faced throughout his career, and provided valuable advice for those interested
                        in pursuing a career in game development. 
                        <br><br>
                        It was an inspiring session that motivated many of us to continue pursuing our passion for programming and game development.

                        This was a part of our bi-annual hackathon event where we had pairs of students compete to solve the most problems over a 3 day period.
                        The event was a great success, with many students participating and showcasing their skills in problem-solving and coding.
                        <br><br>
                        The hackathon provided an opportunity for students to collaborate, learn from each other, and push their limits in a competitive yet friendly environment.
